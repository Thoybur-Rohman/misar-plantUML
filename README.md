# MiSAR PlantUML
MiSAR PlantUML is a specialized tool designed within the Eclipse Modeling Framework to simplify the visualization of microservices architecture. It takes a MiSAR Platform Independent Model as input and generates UML graphical representations, offering a clear and insightful view of the system. Additionally, the tool provides valuable metrics, such as the count of microservices, to enhance your understanding of the model.

## Key Features

- **UML Generation:** Easily create UML diagrams from MiSAR Platform Independent Models for a visual representation of the microservices architecture.

- **Metrics Reporting:** Obtain essential metrics about the MiSAR Platform Independent Model, including the number of microservices, to gain deeper insights.

- **User-friendly:** The tool is packaged as a downloadable JAR file, ensuring a seamless integration process into your Eclipse Modeling Framework environment.
